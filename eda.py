**Insight:** This chart compares how profitable movies are based on their **audience rating** (like PG, R, etc.). 

**ROI** stands for **Return on Investment**, which tells us how much money a movie earned compared to what it cost to make. 

For example, a movie with a **ROI of 2** means it earned **2× its cost**, or **200% profit**.

The box plot helps show:
- The **typical ROI** for each rating (middle line of each box)
- How much the ROI varies (height of the box and lines)
- Any **outliers** — movies that made way more (or less) money than others

 From the chart, we can see that **R-rated and PG-rated** movies have many high-profit outliers. But most movies, regardless of rating, have ROI under 5 (or 500%). 

To keep things easy to read, we limited the y-axis to 500. Otherwise, a few extreme cases (like a very cheap movie that made a lot of money) stretch the chart too much and hide useful patterns.

# 🧠 Insightful Summary
st.subheader("🧠 Final Insights")
st.markdown("""
-  Movies with bigger budgets usually earn more, but not all high-budget films are profitable.
-  ROI (Return on Investment) helps us understand how much money a movie made **compared to its cost**. It's a great way to find low-budget movies that made huge profits.
-  Top-rated movies often have a lot of votes, showing they are popular and respected.
-  Studios like Warner Bros. and Universal lead in terms of output and earnings.
-  Movie production has increased a lot since 2000.
-  Some low-rated movies still made great profits — meaning popularity and profitability don’t always go hand in hand.
